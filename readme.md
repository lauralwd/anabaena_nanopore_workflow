This directory contains data and analyses for RNA guided transposition in anabaena

anabaena reference strain: Nostoc spec pcc7120 
reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000009705.1/

work done includes two approaches, first a denovo approach and second a reference based approach

The denovo approach includes:
1 de-novo assembly with flye (dir denovo)
2 assembly polishing with medaka (dir denovo/....

The reference based approach includes
1 mapping to the ncbi reference with minimap2 ()
2 variant calling with medaka ()

1 mapping to the reference with nglmr
2 structural variant valling with sniffles
